# Approach - Have a tree structure and keep adding character to the tree. Mark the last character for a given node as end to id.
# TC - O(n), SC - O(n)

# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
